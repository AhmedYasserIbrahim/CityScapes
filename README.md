# Automated Pinterest City Wallpaper Posting System

This is an automated system that generates random city wallpapers and posts them to a Pinterest board twice a day. It leverages various Make Academy (formerly Integromat) integrations and the Eden AI platform to fetch city imagery, create the wallpaper layouts, and publish the content to Pinterest programmatically. We're also providing a detailed blueprint to help others implement a similar system.

## Features

- Fetches random city imagery from a stock photo integration, powered by the Eden AI platform
- Generates unique wallpaper designs with the city photos, overlaid text, and graphical elements using Make Academy's design tools
- Automatically posts the new wallpaper images to a designated Pinterest board on a 12-hour schedule
- Includes logging and error handling to monitor the system's health and performance
- Comprehensive blueprint for implementing a similar automated wallpaper posting system

## Technologies Used

- Make Academy (formerly Integromat) for the core automation workflows
- Eden AI platform for advanced image processing and generation
- Stock photo integration (e.g., Unsplash) for city imagery, leveraging Eden AI
- Make Academy's design tools for wallpaper creation
- Pinterest integration for automated posting
- Scheduling triggers for the 12-hour posting interval
- Cloud-based hosting and deployment (e.g., Make Academy's hosted solutions)

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to set up the necessary Make Academy integrations and the Eden AI platform. Once that's done, you can configure the various steps in the automation workflow, customize the wallpaper designs, target Pinterest board, and posting schedule to fit your needs.

We've also included a detailed blueprint that walks through the entire process, from setting up the integrations to customizing the system. This blueprint can be a helpful guide for anyone wishing to implement a similar automated wallpaper posting system.

Feel free to fork this repository and adapt the Make Academy workflows and Eden AI integrations for your own use case! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
